# 📘 Project Euler: Mathematical Explorations

This repository is a **mathematical and computational exploration** of selected **Project Euler problems**, designed to bridge **rigorous mathematical reasoning** with **computational implementation**.

## 🎯 Purpose and Philosophy

> *"Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things."* — Henri Poincaré

The purpose of this project is not only to find numerical answers, but to **understand the structure, proofs, and asymptotic behaviors** that lie beneath each problem.

Each solution is built upon a dual foundation:
1. **Formal Mathematical Analysis (LaTeX)** — proofs, lemmas, propositions, and theorems;
2. **Computational Realization (Python / Jupyter)** — verified algorithms and empirical validation.

## 🧠 Mathematical Focus

Each notebook and LaTeX document focuses on:
- The **underlying recurrence relations** or **combinatorial structures** of the problem;
- The **proof of correctness** for derived formulas or algorithms;
- The **asymptotic growth** and analytical behavior of resulting sequences;
- The **relationship between discrete and continuous models** (e.g., sums vs. integrals, discrete recursions vs. differential analogs).

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

**Languages & Tools**
- 🐍 Python 3.12 (with `uv`, `numpy`, `sympy`, `jupyter`)
- 📘 VS Code (extensions: Python, Jupyter, LaTeX Workshop)
- 📄 LaTeX (MiKTeX + SumatraPDF)
- ⚙️ GitHub Actions (for automated LaTeX builds)

## 🔬 Research Perspective

This repository treats computational mathematics as an **experimental science**:

- Hypothesis generation from numerical patterns;
- Proof verification through symbolic reasoning;
- Construction of efficient algorithms inspired by theorems;
- Asymptotic and structural analysis of recursive systems.

It aims to evolve into a **library of mathematical mini-papers**, each combining
theoretical rigor with reproducible computational evidence.

## 🧮 Long-Term Vision

To create a *Mathematical Atlas* of Project Euler problems — each entry containing:
- A theorem-driven formulation;
- Analytical and computational solutions;
- Cross-references to known results in number theory and combinatorics.
